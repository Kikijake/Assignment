    <h3>My Future Plan</h3>
    <p>As i decribe on the firstpage,i'm intrested in developing software and i'm planning to make myself 
        improve in that subject.Now i'm attending a scholor course from National Cyber City education website.
        I also have an idea to go to Japan because in Japan there're alot of job offering with IT.So i'm also 
        learning Japanese language.I also am trying to learn English.English is a global language and i like traveling,
        so i need to learn English in order to communicate with other people from all around the world as i travel.
        Other from these things, i want to install a nice destop at my home.Because i think if i have a better device 
        than my current low-end laptop, that will be easier for me to learn things from the internet and to run 
        more intresting software.
    </p>
