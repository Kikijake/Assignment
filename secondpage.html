    <h3>My Current Job</h3>
    <p>Now i'm working as an office asssistant in an international school called Yangon Academy International 
        School.I like my working enviroment.Because there are a lot of professional teachers and i can learn so 
        many things from them.Most of them are foreigners.That's a good thing as i can pratice my listening and 
        speaking skills of English.I got paid a less salary but on the other hand i get more free time as both 
        Saturday and Sunday are off.Also there are so many long holidays as this is school.The best thing is 
        there's no pressure with my work.I'm happy working at Yangon Academy International School.
