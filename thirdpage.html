    <h3>My First Job</h3>
    <p>My very first job was working as a waitor at a restaurant called Cozy Corner.
        I got paid only 80000 on the first month and it was my first earned money.The enviroment was not 
        very good.I didn't quite like that job.But good thing for me is i got a lot of experience with marketing
        customer service and social skills.And also got the chance to learn about people.As customers are from 
        variety standard of livings , i got the chance to see every opnion from every angle about the world through
        their convirsations.Yeah, this is a few things about my first job
